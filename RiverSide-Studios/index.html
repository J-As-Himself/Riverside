                    When we first work with our clients, for instance during your shoot, you will probably see us doing a lot of talking and guiding with poses. This is simply because it’s the first time we work together and it’s a way for us to get comfortable around each other. You will see that as you become “experienced”, you will quickly feel at ease and get comfortable around us. This is where we then let you be yourselves and do fun things together whilst we document the moments. 
                    We love making you feel comfortable so you can forget our existence and be yourselves. This way, you will not only get the BEST photographs, but also have a good laugh and forget that your photos are being taken whilst you’re having FUN. Whilst we care about our crafts to the core of our beings, we don’t take life too seriously and are always up for a laugh  But trust us, we’ll be there to celebrate you and document every little moment for you.
